- 🎯 **Test Skip Functionality** - Skip tests by ID or category via profile configuration
- 🔍 **Enhanced Check Coverage** - Expanded from 36 to 53+ security checks across 20+ categories

**New Security Checks**
- Boot/kernel hardening (GRUB password, sysctl parameters)
- File integrity monitoring tools (AIDE, Tripwire, OSSEC)
- Package manager security (GPG verification)
- Logging and auditing (syslog, rsyslog, auditd)
- MAC systems (SELinux, AppArmor enforcement)

**Documentation**
- Added FEATURES_ADDED.md with detailed feature documentation
- Updated README with JSON output examples
- Profile/configuration usage guide
- CI/CD integration examples
- PyYAML dependency documentation
- Updated Lynis comparison table (95% parity achieved)

### Changed
- CLI now supports `--format {text|md|json}` (was `{text|md}`)
