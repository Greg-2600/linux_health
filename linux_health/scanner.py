"""Concurrent port scanner for non-invasive service detection.

Provides TCP connect-based port scanning using concurrent threads to efficiently
probe common service ports on target systems. Results are deterministic and
orderable by port number.

Classes:
    PortStatus: Dataclass representing a single port scan result

Functions:
    scan_ports: Scan multiple ports concurrently with configurable timeout
    _scan_single: Internal function for single port scanning

Example:
    >>> results = scan_ports('192.168.1.100', [22, 80, 443])
    >>> open_ports = [r.port for r in results if r.open]
    >>> print(f'Open ports: {open_ports}')
