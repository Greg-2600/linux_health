## 🆔 Lynis-Compatible Test ID System

Linux Health will adopt standardized test IDs matching Lynis format:

```
Format: [CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]

Examples:
- DBS-1000   Database Security checks
- AUDIT-5000 Audit & Accounting checks
- CONT-8100  Container Security checks
- HTTP-6500  Web Server Hardening checks
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Compatibility with Lynis documentation
- ✅ Clear categorization and organization
- ✅ Scalable numbering scheme (100 per category)
- ✅ Easy cross-reference in reports

---

## ✅ Quality Standards

All new checks will maintain v2.0 standards:

**Code Quality**
- Black formatter (88-char line length)
- Ruff linter (zero errors)
- Type hints required
- Google-style docstrings
- >70% test coverage

**Testing**
- Unit tests for all scenarios (pass/warn/fail)
- Mock SSH responses
- Error handling tests
- Integration tests
- Coverage reports per phase

**Documentation**
- Each check includes Lynis test ID
- Phase-by-phase implementation guides
- Code examples for each check
- Test specifications
- README updates for each phase

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Phase Completion Requirements:**
- ✅ All checks implemented and tested
- ✅ >70% test coverage maintained
- ✅ Zero linting/formatting errors
