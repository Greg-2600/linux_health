## Security Considerations

Linux Health performs **read-only operations** on target systems:

- ✅ No system modifications
- ✅ No privileged operations
- ✅ No data exfiltration
- ✅ Local report generation only

However, users should:
- Use SSH key-based authentication in production (not passwords)
- Restrict scanner access to authorized network ranges
- Scan systems with your organization's security policies
- Audit scan results before acting on them

## Dependency Security

We actively monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities via:
- Regular `pip-audit` checks
- GitHub Dependabot alerts
- Manual security audits

Report dependency vulnerabilities using the process above.
